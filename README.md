### Instructions

This program is pretty simple. To get it to work, you need a spotify client id, client secret, & redirect uri. 

Then all you need to do is follow the input prompts and enter the data.

This will then make a playlist on your spotify account. 

### Need to add

I need to add error handling for proper date input, will do later. This was mainly a proof of concept project for a class I took.
