### Instructions

This program is pretty simple. To get it to work, you need to register a developer app and get the following stuff.

1. client_id
2. client_secret
3. redirect_uri (note you can use example.com or something because you have to just paste in whatever spotify opens in your browser.)

Either store them as environment variables or in your script as strings.

Then all you need to do is follow the input prompts and enter the data.

This will then make a playlist on your spotify account for specific dates in time!
